Implementing a Time Series Forecasting model in Python, by using FBProphet.

The forecasting model should be able to predict the Sunspots by using Facebookâ€™s Prophet Time Series Forecasting model. Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality.

Sunspots are temporary phenomena on the Sun's photosphere that appear as spots darker than the surrounding areas. They are regions of reduced surface temperature caused by concentrations of magnetic field flux that inhibit convection. 
Sunspots usually appear in pairs of opposite magnetic polarity. Their number varies according to the approximately 11-year solar cycle.

We will test the forecasting model in three (3) distinct datasets. On Daily, Monthly, and Yearly Mean sunspots.
